## Ciao! ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on [Flip01](https://github.com/pescetti-studio/Flip01-CPU): a small and simple 8-bit CPU.
- ðŸ’¬ I wrote a [free manual](https://medium.com/@biasolo.riccardo/flip01-a-simple-yet-versatile-8-bit-cpu-fc01c36d5922) for that CPU: perfect for anyone wanting to get into the world of processors without overcomplicating things
