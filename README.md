## Ciao! ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± Currently fixing problems that didnâ€™t even exist.
- ðŸ’¬ I built a tiny 8-bit educational CPU called [Flip01](https://github.com/pescetti-studio/Flip01-CPU): complete with an assembler, Logisim simulation, and all the tools youâ€™d need to mess around with it or use it for learning. Everythingâ€™s in the dedicated repo. </br> I also put together a free beginner-friendly guide, which you can check out on [Medium](https://medium.com/@biasolo.riccardo/flip01-a-simple-yet-versatile-8-bit-cpu-fc01c36d5922)
